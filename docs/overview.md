## Repository structure

This repository contains three main folders: `docs`, `figs`, and `results`. The `docs` folder contains the project documentation, such as this file and the project's `readme.md`, the `figs` folder contains the figures used in the article, and the `results` folder contains various measurements and formatted tables used in the article.

Outside these folders are the `.ipynb` Jupyter notebooks used to create the figures, measurements, and tables contained in `figs` and `results`.
