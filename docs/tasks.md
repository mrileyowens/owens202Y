### Open

- [ ] Consider whether it is more appropriate to report fluxes (rather than flux densities) in the seeing simulation
- [ ] Add horizontal, separating lines to tables where applicable to separate the stacked and individual spectra
- [ ] Update flow chart to reflect that the `galfit.ipynb` output also feeds into the final article
- [ ] Add all Python packages and verisons to the software credit in the article
- [ ] Determine the units of the LyÎ± maps and verify the units stated in the documentation and code comments 
- [ ] Update the article's methodology with new details about the MC simulation process
- [ ] Add the descriptions of `nb.ipynb` and `seeing.ipynb` once the results of `seeing.ipynb` are satisfactory
